# Aircraft-Evacuation-GUI
The potency of Aircraft Evacuation plays a vital role in the safety of the passengers on board. Our motive is to create a multi-agent simulator, which would enable the aircraft manufacturers to test the evacuation process of the aircraft. The model is based on a bi-dimensional grid, which acts as a basic structure of the aircraft and multi-agents, which represents passengers who are supposed to be evacuated. Each agent is characterized by the properties of a human. An agent can have properties like motion, sex, response time, position and status. Each cell in the grid represents a capacity, which is occupied by the agent i.e. the passenger. The application of this model is at the time of emergency evacuation of the aircraft.
